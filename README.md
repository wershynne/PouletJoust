<h2>About</h2>
<strong>The Cold War's taken a turn for the odd, and a British cruiser's anchor has caught a Soviet sub.</strong><br/>
<strong>Both must race past the minefields of the North Sea to reach their allies.</strong><br/>
<strong>THE ENEMY CANNOT GO HOME.</strong><br/>


<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
The main goal is to have a functioning difficulty system, obstacle emergence and randomization, health systems, 
environmental effects, and competitive incidents following certain actions.

 
 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
Finish the entire obstacle and difficulty systems and leave all visual fidelities for later. The project should be in a
fully playable state at the least.

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
Game development in an overcontrolled environment involves coding about as much as a baker involves tax fraud. The main
tasks involved in a functioning game with an engine and assortment of prefabricated development tools is in asset 
management and process allocation, rather than any low-level coding concepts. Due to this, I've given myself the additional
challenges of fabricating my own world systems and environmental processes to set onto the old renderer.
