Concept: 2D game Ship Chicken
A ship and a submarine chained together, top screen WASD and bottom screen keyboard for two players
There's a good amount of slack but they can mess with each other
The submarine has bigger obstacles to dodge but the ship has weather to deal with
Really just a ship sprite and submarine sprite layered on top of a background that keeps coming to the camera
Mines, Rocks, Waves, Lightning, Geysers, Torpedoes and Cannons from other ships nearby
Either one speeds up, both are dragged to speed
5 hp each and no chances for healing, it's a short me vs you 
Once speed is high, BOTH have to choose to slow down to successfully power down
Some obstacles spaced to that it's impossible for both to be unscathed
WW2 setting probably
Soviet sub vs German ship
Game sounds become louder as speed increases
NO MAX SPEED, if they keep ramping up someone dies


Maybe ship selection, bigger=more pull on enemy but slower to evade and bigger target
